Plan:
	1) place a 'submarine' into a 10x10 grid
	2) fire 15 randomly placed test shots into the grid
	3)display ship on grid, display shots fired
	4) process whether ship was hit and display that
	5) display whether the ship is sunk or not 


Classes:
	WaterVehicle 
		-member variables
			-length of ship (in number of grid spaces)
			-starting grid location
			-horizontal or vertical orientation on grid
			-sunk (Boolean indicating whether the ship has been sunk or not)
		-Functions
			-constructors, 
			-accessors/mutators (for location of ship, and for member variables :) )
			-void placeShip() to set ship into grid

Functions:
	void testFire(int _shots) // fires _shots number of shots randomly into the grid.
